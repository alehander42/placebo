*Day's dawning, skins crawling Pure morning,*

that's a web rendering engine written in ruby, using Cairo for rendering, crass for parsing css and oga for parsing html and 
based on a rust tutorial [Let's build a web rendering engine](https://limpet.net/mbrubeck/2014/08/08/toy-layout-engine-1.html)

it's unfinished and likely to stay that way, it was just a playground for me when trying to strenghten my css/layout rules knowledge (if you implement it you will learn it kind of project)
